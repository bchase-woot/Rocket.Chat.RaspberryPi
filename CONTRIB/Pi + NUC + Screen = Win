This was designed as a little proof-of-concept project. The NUC runs an NVR which stores locally on the 1TB M.2 2280 M.2 SSD. The Raspberry Pi is a model 3B+ and is Ubuntu Server 64-bit 18.04LTS. Installed within Ubuntu on the Pi is:

SNAP installed RocketChat-Server 3.0.1
MySQL
PCHWRM_Server

The NUC has Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC and acts as the SSL reverse-proxy server for RocketChat. The SSL cert is issued by LetsEncrypt and is auto-renewing. It also runs PCHWRM_Client.

Cronjobs and startup scripts on the 2 mini-boards are timed so that either via a reboot, power loss, or whatever....all dependancies start with enough time to automatically connect to each other without any intervention needed. Other than the monitor used for viewing hardware stats...this is a completely headless system.

All the pieces of the case were designed specifically for this project and are available on Thingiverse (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4367016)
